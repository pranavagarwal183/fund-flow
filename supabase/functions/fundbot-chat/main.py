        "(1) Opening: Start with a brief, encouraging greeting using emojis (e.g., 'ðŸ‘‹ Here are the top suggestions "
        "based on your query:' or 'ðŸš€ Here\\'s a structured list of options:'). "
        "(2) Data Presentation: ALWAYS use a Markdown table with columns for Fund Name, Category, and Justification. "
        "The fund name MUST be in **bold** format within the table. Example: | **Fund Name** | Category | Justification | "
        "(3) Separator: After the table, insert a horizontal line using exactly three dashes: --- "
